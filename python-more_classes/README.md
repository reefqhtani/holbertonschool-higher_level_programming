# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project is part of the Holberton School higher-level programming curriculum.
It deepens the understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python by
exploring more advanced concepts such as class attributes, instance attributes,
special methods, static methods, class methods, encapsulation, and properties.

You will continue to learn how objects work internally, how Python manages
attributes, and how to write clean, Pythonic OOP code.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General OOP Concepts
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is  
- “First-class everything” in Python  
- What a class is  
- What an object or instance is  
- The difference between a class and an instance  
- What an attribute is  
- Public, protected, and private attributes  
- What `self` refers to  
- What a method is  
- The role of the special `__init__` method  
- Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding  
- What a property is  
- Difference between an attribute and a property  

### Special Python Methods
- What the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods do  
- Difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`  
- How to implement them correctly  

### Class-Level Concepts
- Class attributes vs instance attributes  
- How to bind attributes to classes and objects  
- How to dynamically add new attributes  
- What a class method is  
- What a static method is  

### Internal Mechanics
- What `__dict__` contains for a class or instance  
- How Python resolves attribute access (method resolution order)  
- How to use the built-in `getattr` function
