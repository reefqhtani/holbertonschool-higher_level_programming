# Python - Classes and Objects

This project is part of the Holberton School higher-level programming curriculum.
It introduces the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python,
covering what classes and objects are, how to define them, and how to use attributes,
methods, and encapsulation properly.

The focus of this project is to understand:
- What OOP means and why it is useful
- The concept of “first-class everything” in Python
- The difference between a class and an instance/object
- What attributes are (public, protected, private)
- The role of the `self` parameter
- What methods and constructors (`__init__`) do
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Properties vs. getters and setters
- The Pythonic way to manage attributes using properties
- How Python stores attributes internally using `__dict__`
- How Python resolves attribute access
- How to use `getattr`

All tasks are implemented in Python 3 and follow **pycodestyle** rules.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**, Python **3.8.5**
- First line of every file: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow **pycodestyle (2.7.\*)**
- All files must be executable
- Every module, class, and method must contain proper documentation (docstrings)
- No external modules may be imported unless specified
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
