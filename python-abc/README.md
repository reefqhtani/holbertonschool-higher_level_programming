# Python OOP - Abstract Class, Interface, Subclassing

This project focuses on advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including abstract base classes (ABCs), interfaces and duck typing, subclassing built-in types, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and mixins.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define and use **abstract base classes (ABCs)** to enforce required methods in subclasses
- Understand **interfaces** and apply **duck typing** to design flexible APIs
- Subclass standard base classes (e.g., `list`, `dict`, iterators) to customize behavior
- Override methods to extend or modify base class functionality
- Apply **multiple inheritance** to model complex relationships
- Use **mixins** to compose behavior across unrelated classes

## Requirements

- Python 3
- All Python files should start with:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
