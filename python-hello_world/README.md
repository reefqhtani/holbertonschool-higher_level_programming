This project contains my first Python scripts as part of the Holberton School curriculum, introducing fundamental Python programming concepts.

## Project Overview

This project serves as an introduction to Python programming, covering basic syntax, printing, strings, and Python coding conventions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to work with strings in Python
- Understanding indexing and slicing in Python
- The official Python coding style (PEP8)
- How to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.*)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
